<!--BODY -->
           <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);background-color:black;">
            Front-end web development is responsible for the look and feel of a website. This means how colors, type, icons, and images appear. Increasingly, front-end development has to account for how a website looks on all devices, from desktop to tablet to phone. Typical programming languages include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Front-end developers keep up with cutting-edge trends in web design and development to make <strong>sure websites are optimized</strong> for users and search engines — and with security <em>best practices in mind.</em>
            </p> 
        <h3 style="color: white">Back-end web development</h3>
            <P style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
            Back-end web development is responsible for building and maintaining the code that runs a website. This code connects the website to the server and ensures that data flows properly to the website and that transactions are processed correctly. Typical programming languages include Java (different from JavaScript), PHP, and MySQL; newer tools include Python and Golang. Back-end web developers can keep up with changes in technology by participating in networking communities that share coding tips and support.</P>

        <a name="Full-stack web development"></a>
            <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
            	Full-stack web development covers both front-end and back-end responsibilities. Depending on the complexity of a website, a full-stack developer may be responsible for all facets of its development, from the server side to the user interface. <mark>Many full-stack developers may still specialize in one aspect of web development, but their broad experience is useful in troubleshooting or speeding up a build or redesign. Full-stack developers are often responsible for identifying cutting-edge technologies, such as enhanced programming languages (or even no- or low-code trends) and blockchain, that can be used to strengthen websites’ business capabilities.</mark>

           <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
           	What defines a successful website developer? The following are just a few of the skills that can help professionals advance their careers in web development.
           </p>
           <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
           	<b><u>Programming abilities</u></b>. Strong coding skills are essential. Mastering programming languages such as HTML and CSS is just a start. Technology changes fast, so a willingness to always be learning new coding techniques is important.
           </p>
           <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
           	<b><u>Attention to detail</u></b>. Testing and debugging code requires patience and analytical skills to understand what went wrong and how to fix <sup> it.</sup>
           </p>
           <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
           	<b><u><i>Creative thinking<i></u></b>. Successful websites have to attract and keep users, as well as be visible to search engines. Web developers have to be creative in how they pull together user experience, search engine optimization, <del>and other factors in building a good site.</del>
           </p>
           <p style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255)">
           	<i>While many web designers work alone, most work for an organization. Understanding the needs of the sales department, for example, is crucial in creating a successful website. <sub>Collaborating with user experience or content creation</sub> experts is also a necessary skill.<br><br>

           Web developers can rely on a variety of community resources for everything from finding a job to helping with tough coding problems. Web experts advise new developers to become part of these <strike>communities.</strike>
