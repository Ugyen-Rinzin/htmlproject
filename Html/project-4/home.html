			 <h1 align="center">EMPOWER YOURSELF</h1>
			 <hr>
			 <p><strong>If you’re thinking about going back to school, applying for a promotion, or making another life change, the first step is to nurture and embrace the confidence you’ll need to put yourself forward. Confidence not only helps you understand where your starting line is; it helps you lay out the path you’ll need to reach the finish. This is where self-empowerment comes in.
			 	<p>Self-empowered people take control of their lives by setting goals and taking actionable steps to achieve them. They not only understand how to get things done but also are confident, focused, and comfortable making decisions that guide them toward their future. If your self-confidence is shaky or you’re insecure about your ability to achieve your ambitions, you can take several steps to live a more empowered life.
			 </strong></p>
			 <h2>What Is Self-Empowerment?</h2>
			 <p>
			 	Self-empowerment means making a conscious decision to take charge of your destiny. It involves making positive choices, taking action to advance, and being confident in your ability to make and execute decisions. Self-empowered people understand their strengths and weaknesses and are motivated to learn and achieve.<p>
			 	For example, if someone is laid off, they can be passive in their job search and wait for a recruiter to find them on LinkedIn — or they can take proactive steps toward finding a new and better job: contacting former colleagues, researching opportunities, updating their marketable skills, and revamping their resume. Self-empowerment allows individuals to recognize that they have the power to make choices that can help them achieve their goals.
			 </p>
			 <h2>Tips to Achieve Self-Empowerment</h2>
			 <p>
			 	If you’re striving to attain personal empowerment, focus on your drive, identify what you can control, and keep an objective, goal-oriented mindset. The following seven tips can help you achieve self-empowerment.
			
			 <h3>Develop a Positive Attitude</h3>
			 <p>
			 	People who believe they control their own destiny — rather than giving in to external concepts such as fate, luck, or circumstance — are more likely to take charge of their future. Cultivate a positive attitude and outlook by evaluating your strengths and weaknesses, pursuing your passions, and trusting in your ability.
			 	<h3>Set Reasonable Goals</h3>
			 	<p>Measurable, achievable goals are an important component of self-empowerment, and understanding how to set them can help you feel good about your achievements. If you want to run a marathon, start with smaller, increasing distances rather than trying to run 26.2 miles on day one.
			 	<h3>Surround Yourself with Positive People</h3>	
			 	<p>Laughter is contagious — and so are pessimism and negativity. Surrounding yourself with like-minded, motivated people can help you feel empowered to achieve your goals. If your self-esteem takes a blow, schedule time with positive friends, peers, and family members. Experiencing their positivity can improve your mental well-being, minimize your negativity, and empower you to follow your dreams.
